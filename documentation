Design Decision - Local Language News Aggregator with Weather Integration

Objective:
The objective of this project is to create a local language news aggregator that provides users with news articles in their preferred language and also offers weather information based on their geolocation.

Weather Information Retrieval:

Geolocation: The application retrieves the user's latitude and longitude to determine their location accurately.

Weather API: To obtain weather information, the application integrates with a reliable weather API. The latitude and longitude of the user's location are passed as parameters to the API.

Weather Page UI:

Color Scheme: The weather page UI incorporates a custom blue color scheme. This choice aims to provide a visually appealing and intuitive representation of weather-related information.

Background: The background of the weather page is set to the chosen shade of blue, creating a cohesive visual theme throughout the interface.

Weather Display: A prominent image div is included on the page, featuring an image of clouds. This image helps users quickly associate the content with weather-related information.

News Retrieval:

News Source: The application fetches news articles from the gnews.io API, a reliable news source that provides a wide range of news topics.

Search Functionality: A user-friendly input box is provided, allowing users to enter specific keywords or topics they wish to search for within the news articles. This feature enables users to find news articles related to their interests, such as "cricket" or "football."

Language Selection: A select box is included, enabling users to choose their preferred language for viewing the news articles. This feature ensures that the news aggregator caters to users' language preferences.

News Page UI:

Color Scheme: The news page UI incorporates a professional combination of black and white, providing a clean and visually appealing design.

Card Layout: News articles are displayed in visually pleasing cards. Each card contains essential information, including an image, title, description, and published date.

Clickable Titles: Users can click on the news article titles to access the full news page, allowing for a seamless browsing experience.

Navigation Bar:

Design: A navigation bar is implemented at the top of the application's interface.

Color Scheme: The navigation bar features a sleek black color scheme, providing a clear visual contrast to the rest of the interface.

Navigation Links: The navigation bar includes two links, "News" and "Weather," enabling users to switch between the news and weather pages effortlessly.

Conclusion:
This design decision outlines the key elements and considerations for developing a local language news aggregator with weather integration. The UI design choices, color schemes, and functionality aim to provide users with an intuitive, visually appealing, and seamless experience when accessing news articles and weather information.
